LibPdIntegration ToDo
---------------------
- Create singleton LibPdManager class to handle all of the global operations
  libpd requires us to work with.
- printHook deletion in OnApplicationQuit()?
- Linux build of libpd.
- Build in my own spatialisation code?
- Should I separate the LibPD stuff out from the MonoBehaviour?
    - I do like the single-file approach for a library.
- More robust Print implementation (let users redirect to their own classes).
- Add a public array of symbols to bind to when LibPdInstance is constructed,
  so clients don't need to call Bind()/UnBind() themselves?
